# ms_nbs

Code for comparing brain network structure between groups and within a group over time. 

This code has been originally written for studying attention and motor control in MS patients in collaboration with Giovanni de Marco et al. The code strongly makes use of the Network Based Statistic (Zalesky et al. 2010, NeuroImage 53(4); https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053811910008852?via%3Dihub), using the bctpy Python implementation by Roan LaPlante (https://github.com/aestrivex/bctpy).
